Welcome to Stranded on the Moon! Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: The game requires Python to run. If Python is not installed, the setup script will automatically download and install it for you.
- **Windows OS**: This setup is tailored for Windows users and uses a batch script (`.bat`) to handle the setup.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Initial Setup

1. **Download the Game Files**: Download and extract the game files to a folder on your computer.

2. **Run the Setup Script**: Double-click on the `setup.bat` file.

   - If Python is not installed on your system, setup will fail and urge you to install Python.
   - If this is your first time running the game, the script will create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
   - If Python and the dependencies are already installed, the script will skip these steps.

### Step 2: Running the Game

1. **Run the Run Script**: Double-click on the `run.bat` file game.

2. **Enjoy the Game**: After you run the script, the game will start, and you can begin playing!

### Troubleshooting

- **Python Not Installed**: If Python is not installed, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure that Python is added to your system's PATH during installation.
- **Dependencies Not Installed**: If the game fails to start because dependencies are missing, you can try running `setup.bat` again to ensure everything is properly set up.

### Customization

If you want to make changes to the game:

1. Open the `game.py` file in an IDE of your choice.
2. Modify the code as needed and, save your changes.
3. Run `run.bat` again to test your updates.
